Welcome to the DIGITALL guard rails for the Microsoft PowerPlatform.

Here we have a constantly growing framework for our projects, the systems we operate and our experience and approaches.

These are the minimum standards for new projects; deviations are permitted and possible, but must be documented and justified.

      Together we unleash the power of Citizen Developers

    If you have any suggestions, ideas or additions, you can contact us directly internally in the architects' circle or start a discussion on Github or set a PR.
